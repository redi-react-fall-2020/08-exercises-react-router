"Broken Routing" Exercise

### OBJECTIVES:
1) Bug: Multiple "pages" are showing up at the same time when we only expect one at a time. Fix this.

2) Bug: Clicking through the link pages does not properly switch between the page components. Fix this.

3) Swap the order so the navigation bar is below the page content.

4) Modify the app so '/contact' shows "Contact Page" and "/contact/us" shows "Contact Page for US".

### STRETCH:

1) Add a login field in App.
2) Update the app state with the username entered in the login field.
3) Pass that username down to your Home page so that it's personalized and says "Hello <username>, welcome home."
